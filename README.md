The IEEE Student Branch at MITS provides a dynamic platform for students to showcase their creativity and technical skills in various forms of media, including photography, photo editing, video editing, design, and poster making. The club is known for its exceptional ability to create visually appealing posters and content. We also organize all college events, ensuring their smooth execution and success.

The **IEEE SB MITS** contributions are especially noteworthy during the annual tech fest, Shreshta 2023, where the club's expertise played an integral role in enhancing the overall experience of attendees. The club's captivating posters and visually engaging content helped to attract a larger audience and create a buzz around the event. The team worked with sheer determination to make sure the event was conducted properly and that everything was in order.

Apart from creating media content, the IEEE SB MITS also conducts regular workshops to teach students how to use professional software such as Photoshop and Canva. These workshops equip students with industry-standard tools and techniques, which not only enhance their creative potential but also prepare them for future careers in media and design.
